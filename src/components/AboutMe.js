        I am a full-stack engineer with a wide breadth of skills that lay on all
        sides of the professional spectrum. With an undergraduate degree from
        Binghamton University in english rhetoric and global culture, in
        addition to intensive software development training from General
        Assembly, I not only possess the humanistic skills required to develop
        the mission of a company, but also the technical skills to bring that
        mission to life. I am particularly interested in developing interactive
        software with a dynamic and fluid connection between frontend and
        backend systems, as well as developing software that provides flawless
        and meaningful service to the user.
